# EngineSynth

A tool to create engine noises for beamng!

# Demo

These engine sounds were created with this tool:

![F1_3.0_V10](/demo/F1_3.0_V10_DEMO.mov)

![F1_1.6_V6](/demo/F1_1.6_V6_DEMO.mov)

Configs for these engines are located in /demo/ directory.

# Dependencies

This app requires .NET 6.0 to run.

# Simple Usage

1. Drag and drop some percussive sounds into the samples area.
> Notes:
>   Total sample count must not be less than cylinder count.
>   Drum kit samples like snares tend to sound nice.

2. Select the number of cylinders, and power strokes per revolution.
3. Name your engine, select the folder of your mod and hit render!
4. You will get two beamng sounds: enginename_engine and enginename_exhaust
